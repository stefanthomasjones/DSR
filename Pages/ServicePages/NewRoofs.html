If you have a business, a leaky roof is a major headache. You need to get it sorted ASAP, so you and your team can keep working. </p>

<h2 class="margin">Do I need a New Roof?</h2>
<p class="margin">Knowing when you need a new roof isn’t always obvious, but there are a few signs you should look for:</p>
</div>  

<div class="list">
<h3>Water Damage & Leaks</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If you see any water damage in your home, it may be because of a roof leak. Some people assume that water damage is from faulty windows or damp, and although this can be the case, you should still get your roof checked as soon as possible.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mould and Moss Growth</h3>
<ul>
    <li>This often goes hand in hand with water damage, but if find any mould a faulty roof could be the cause. If you live or work in an old building, a bit of mould or mildew is almost inevitable, and easy to keep on top of if you find it early. But if it’s more than you’re used to, or is getting out of hand, contact the professionals.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Light Coming Through your Roof</h3>
<ul>
    <li>This is an obvious one, and almost certainly because of the roof. Cracks and holes in your roof are serious, and need to be repaired as soon as you spot them. We recommend turning off the lights in your home and checking your ceilings every now and again to find any gaps.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Loose Roof Tiles</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If you’re losing roof tiles, or if you spot any loose ones during your annual roof check, just replacing them isn’t the answer. Even if it’s the result of bad weather, loose tiles can mean a weak roof – which should never be ignored.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sagging Roof</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If you notice the top of your roof isn’t a straight line along the ridge, this is a sign of sagging. This can be caused by water damage, faulty roof materials, or it wasn’t fitted properly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Damaged Flashing</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Flashing is a material we use around chimneys and vents. This sticks out slightly from the roof and is designed to stop water getting in via a more vulnerable part of the roof. If it is damaged, it isn’t working well, and should be replaced before it starts leaking.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h2>The Benefits of a New Roof</h2>
<P>A new roof isn’t just about repairing damage. A new roof is a significant investment that can enhance the aesthetics, value, and energy efficiency of your home.<br>

    Don’t skip past that last point either! With energy bills on the rise, we need to do everything we can to improve the efficiency of our homes. Your roof is key to how well the building stores energy – keeping it warm in winter and cool in summer.
    <br><br>
    Any gaps, shoddy materials, or even just age will directly affect your energy usage. We use the latest equipment and techniques to fit roofs that are future-proof. Even with a roof replacement, we do more than just patch holes and clean gutters.
    <br><br>
    Your home and place of work are more than just places to spend the day. They’re an investment, and a new roof is a huge selling point.
    <br><br>
    Even if you have no plans to sell at the moment, our roofs are made to last, so they’ll serve you well for as long as you need them.
    <br><br>
    But why should you choose us? Well, it’s because we’re…</P>
